            First offâ€¦he has a name, it's Gulliver!
            He's a trackable traveler who tags along on any adventure you'd like to take him on.
            Hand him off to friends to travel or leave him in a location to hitchhike his way to some amazing destinations.

            It's really up to the adventurer who's picked him up!
            He can ride a bike, backpack, ride a horse, go four wheeling, or even relax on a beach.
            The real fun is following Gulliver on his expedition with everyone.
            As he travels, he tracks his journey at https://galavanting-gnome.surge.sh/ and allows all the fun to be shared on his social media.

            Gulliver lives in 2019 and is equipped with the capability to connect to 2G networks to identify his location every [amount of time] and send his location online to track his whereabouts.

            Is there etiquette to having a Galavanting Gnome?
          </Typography>
          <Typography component="p" gutterBottom>
            Use the Golden Rule when you find a Gulliver!
            When on vacation, you want to see sites and do fun things, not sit in a trunk or on a shelf.
            The same applies to our short-statured friend.
            It's our goal to see the gnome travel as much as possible!
          </Typography>
          <Typography component="p">
            If you plan on holding Gulliver for more than a few weeks or have damaged him by accident, do not hesitate to reach out to us for support {process.env.REACT_APP_SUPPORT_EMAIL}.

            It's highly discouraged to search for, or leave, Gulliver in residential areas.
