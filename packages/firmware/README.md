Galavanting Gnome Firmware
==========================
This project uses [Platform.IO][platform-io]. Follow it's [setup instructions][pio-setup] to get started.

Caveats
-------
I have not been able to program the leonardo or my uno without using an [USBTinyISP][usbtiny]. I have not been able to
get the normal usb programming working outside the Arduino IDE.
